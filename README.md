# NeuroBytes Vestibular System
NeuroBytes are open-source hardware neuron simulators designed and sold by [NeuroTinker, LLC](http://www.neurotinker.com/). The Vestibular System boards emulate the portion of the inner ear responsible for orientation.  

All NeuroBytes products are based on the ST32L0x series of ARM Cortex-M0+ 32-bit microcontrollers. The boards were designed in KiCad and Inkscape and are released under the terms of the GPL, v3.0.

This repository is a continuation of the 8-bit ATtiny design called [NeuroBytes v0.91](https://github.com/zakqwy/neurobytes). The two series are not compatible.

## Project Status
This project is in alpha. The firmware is in progress and the API may change at any time. The PCB design is physically tested but has not yet been manufactured at scale.

## More Information
The NeuroBytes GitHub repositories store engineering information and make the design history of the project available to the public. Hardware- and firmware-specific README.md files can be found in their appropriate subdirectories. 

We encourage community involvement in our efforts, keeping in mind that hardware availability is currently quite limited.
